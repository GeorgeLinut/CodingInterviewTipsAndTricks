# Part 1. Basic tree algorithms.

    In order traversal (Left Root Right) 4 2 5 1 3  
    Pre order traversal (Root Left Right) 1 2 4 5 3  
    Post order traversal (Left Right Root) 4 5 2 3 1  
    
An easy way of remebering these traversal is to keep in mind that  
you have to place the Root in Left Right as the first word indicates you.  
Example Pre order: the root is before Left Right  
The python code for the traversals can be found in tree_traversals.py  

    Level order tree traversal.
    Mirror tree.
