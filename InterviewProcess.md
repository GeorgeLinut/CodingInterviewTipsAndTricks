# Phone interview with Recruiter
A lot of companies such Microsoft, Google, Toptal have a phone interview with a   
recruiter as their first part of the interview process.  
Most of the time this is a short interview (under 30 minutes) which tests you communication  
skills more than anything else. This way you don't waste too much time interviewing a person who  
can't speak Enghish.  

The first thing that a recruiter would ask you is to tell a few words about yourself, think about this
before the interview so you won't stutter at the interview.  
Also keep it simple, the recruiter does not want to know your entire story, just tell them when and where you gratuated  
where do you work now and a thing that would reflect that you are a good match for that company (ex: work on freelance projects  
in my spare time, strong background in algorithms and data structures, acm awards etc)  
  
The next part of the interview will be focused on behavioral questions  
A few common questions:  
    1. Tell me about yourself?  
    2. What are your greatest professional strengths?  
    3. Why did you leave (or why are you leaving) your job?  
    4. What is your greatest professional achievement?  
    5. Where do you see yourself in five years?  
    6. Why should we hire you?  
    7. What do you know about the company?  
    8. Have you got any questions?  
Your answers should reflect past experience that showcases your skills and your interest in the company.  
Having a prepared answer for them definately helps.  

Sometimes a recruiter can also ask you brain teasers.  
Usually these riddles are known ones such as the island riddle(https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/9979/brooklyn-99-riddle-weighing-islanders).  
Great Brooklyn 99 episode by the way.
