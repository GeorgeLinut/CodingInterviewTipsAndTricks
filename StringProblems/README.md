# Strings.  
String related problems are very common at codind interviews.  
There are string problems that you can solve in one line and string problems that require  
knowledge about algorithms such as KMP to have the desired complexity.  
We will give examples of string problems within large range of difficulty.  

# Part 1.  

    For the first round of interviews you won't get difficult problems, they are meant to test your speed  
    and your proficiency in the language you selected (Java, Python).  

1. String compression: transform "aaaabbc" -> "a4b2c1" (string_compression.py)  
2. Remove duplicates: "interviewRepository" -> "intervwrRposy" (string_duplicates.py)  
3. Detect the position of anagrams for a given string and pattern -> "abcbatttab" -> [0,3,8] (pattern_anagram.py)
